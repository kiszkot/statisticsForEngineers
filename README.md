# statisticsForEngineers

Here you can find some of my solutions to statistics problem done during my university course.

Under "Wykłady i ćwiczenia" you can find the problems I worked on. They are taken from the laboratory part of the course.

Under "LaTex" you can find the tex files of my solutions as well as pdf files explaining how i solved the given probelm.

Under "Scripts" you can find the R scripts used to solve the problems. The naming of the scripts starts with a letter, indicating if it was theory or laboratory,
a number, indicating the laboratory or theory file number. After this you can usually find the name of the problem that was solved in the file.

All of this scripts where made as self taught because our Professor did believe in self learning at university.
